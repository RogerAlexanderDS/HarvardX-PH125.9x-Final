# HarvardX-PH125.9x-Final Submission - RKA
Repository for final CYO project submission

This project involves the use of machine learning algorithms for forecasting of time series solar radiation data.

This repository contains the final (Choose Your Own) Project 2 submission files for the HarvardX-PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone. The repository includes five (5) files: the .Rmd Markdwon Final Report, the pdf Final Report, the Final Algorithm and Analysis R script, and two project data set .csv files.

Note: There are two (2) included .csv files both of which must dowloaded.

The .csv data set files must be downloaded and copied to the local working directory for direct automatic access by the .Rmd and .R script programs. Guidance for determining and verifying the local working directory is given in the R script code.

Thank you.
