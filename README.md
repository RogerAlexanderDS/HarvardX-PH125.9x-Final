Repository for final project submission

This repository includes the final (Choose Your Own) project submission files including final .Rmd Markdwon Report and Report pdf files, final Algorithm and Analysis R script code, and project data set .csv files.

The included .csv files must be downloaded and copied to the local working directory for access by the Rmd Report and R script programs. Guidance for determining and verifying the local working directory is given in the R script code.
